# Tetro-grid

Start with an empty grid (at least 7x7) 

One player is X (red) the other is O (Blue) 
Players take turns adding tetronimos (tetris shapes) any where they want to the grid. 
A player that completes a line, fills that line with their color. 
If any part of the new line already had 1 color, the entire line switches to the new color. 

Any section that is incapable of adding a tetronimo (tetris piece) becomes a dead space. 

Once the entire grid is full, players add up their scores.

(Alternate rules) 
A square with 2 colors (or whos color would have been changed) is dead, turns black, and has no value.

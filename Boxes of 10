# Boxes of 10

Start with a section of graph paper. 
You can use a section of grid of any shape or size. 
The bigger the section, the longer the game. 

Each player chooses X or O

Players take turns filling boxes with numbers frmo 1 to 5. 
If a player connects any group of touching squares that equal exactly 10 points, 
they can write an X or an O (whichever they chose at the start) in the squares used to add up to 10. 

Squares are considered "touching" if they share a side, not if they share a corner.

The person who captures the most squares at the end wins. 

Strategy:
Smaller numbers get you more squares when you capture them.
Avoid putting a number closer than 2 spaces from a group that adds up to at least 4, because the next player can capture them.
Adding a number that would make a group equal greater than 10 may be a strategy to block a square from being captured

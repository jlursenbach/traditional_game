# Odds

## give general overview of the game

In this game, each player takes turns trying to force the game board to add up to either even or odd.

## describe objectives and strategies

The objective is to force the game board to add up to either an even or an odd number. 
Strategically, remember that the only way to change the game state is to add an odd number to the board. 

## provide the rules and an explanation of the rules

### The title of the game: 
Odds

### How many players: 
2

### What materials are needed: 
Pen and Paper

### How does the game progress:

1: Figure out: 

  a) **who goes first**:
  
  b) **who is odd**
  

```
Play Rock paper scissors two times: 

The player who wins the first game goes first 
The player who wins the second game is odd
```

2 gameplay: 

```
draw a wagon wheel with 4 spokes. 

The first player starts on the top spoke. 

They can either write a 1 or a 0 on the tip of that spoke. 

The next player writes either a 1 or a 0 on the next spoke. 

Each time a number is written down, 
you must write it an additional time greater than the last time it was written. 

Ex: 

1 -> 11 -> 0 -> 111 -> 00 -> 1111 -> 11111 -> 000

When there are no more empty spokes left on the wagon wheel, add all of the numbers up. 
When you sum up all of the numbers on the spokes, 
that final number determines the winner (whether it's even or odd)

EX:

1 + 11 + 0 + 111 = 6 (even wins) | 1 + 0 + 00 +11 (odd wins)
```

```
After each round, the loser from that round chooses to either add 1 or two additional spokes to the next round's game board. 
They can also choose if they want to go first or second on the next round. 

The game ends after 5 rounds.

                               1               1         
```

Hint: 

You can only switch the game from even to odd (or vice versa) every other time the number 1 is used.

### If a game board or other game play aid is needed, provide instructions

No game board needed. 

## Alternate rules:

### Alternate rulset #1:
    Instead of 0 and 1, use 1 and 3 so that the state changes are less 

### Alternate Ruleset #2:
    Take turns being first every round.
    If the first player last round lost, keep the same amount of spokes
    If the first player won last round, add a spoke
    
> for a more thematic choice of first player and odd player, play 2 rounds of odds and evens instead of rock paper scissors

> The winner of each round will still be first, and odd (respectively)

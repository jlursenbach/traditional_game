# SPLITS

card scores: 
A-10 = 1-10
K Q J = 10 

Players shuffle a deck of cards and each player draws a hand of three cards. 

## A player has 3 choices: 

1. Bet
2. Split
3. Challenge

Players are allowed to talk about their hands, but can not show them to each-other.

## Bet:
Players take turns betting that the combined total score of the cards is under a certain number.
Each bet must be higher than the last one. 

Each successive bet must be between 1 and 5 points higher than the previous one. 
The first bet starts between 10 and 20 points. 

## Challenge:
A player can challenge a bet: 
If the previous bet goes over the total combined value of the cards, the better loses a number of points equal to the bet 
If the previous bet is under the total combined value of the cards, the challenger looses a number of points equal to the bet

## Split: 
Instead of betting or challenging a player can offer to split with the previous better's bet. 

If the second better agrees to split:
The player that offered the split will gain the number of points the previous player bet. 
Thembetter will gain a number of points equal to the difference between the bet and the total score.

If the second plater refuses the split, the first player can still either conntinue betting or challenge.

# Goal:
The first player to get at least 100 points wins. 
It is possible for both players to win, if they hit over 100 points simultaniously. 

# Shuffle
The deck is shuffled after every challenge
